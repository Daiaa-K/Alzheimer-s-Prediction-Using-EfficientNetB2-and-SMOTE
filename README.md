# Alzheimer-s-Prediction-Using-VGG16-and-SMOTE
Predicting Alzheimer's disease stage and upsampling the data using SMOTE method

Read the data and plotted the number of images in each class, found out that the data was imbalanced 📊
- Loaded data using Image data Generator 🖼 
- Converted our color images to a vector and applied SMOTE method to upsample then reshaped again into images. 🔴 
- Created our VGG16 model and fine tuned it. 🔧 
- Trained the model and evaluated it. 🏃‍♂️ 

Model achieved 98% accuracy on train data and 95% accuracy on test data.
