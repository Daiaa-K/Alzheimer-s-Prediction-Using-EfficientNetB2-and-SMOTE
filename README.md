# Alzheimer-s-Prediction-Using-VGG16-and-SMOTE
Predicting Alzheimer's disease stage and upsampling the data using SMOTE method

- Read the data and plotted the number of images in each class, found out that the data was imbalanced 📊
- Loaded data using Image data Generator 🖼 
- Converted our color images to a vector and applied SMOTE method to upsample then reshaped again into images. 🔴 
- Created our VGG16 model and fine tuned it. 🔧 
- Trained the model and evaluated it. 🏃‍♂️ 

Model achieved 99% accuracy on train data and 99% accuracy on test data.

Also did as streamlit app to showcase the model
